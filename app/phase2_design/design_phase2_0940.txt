Introduction - Triage Android application:
The purpose of this application is to aid in the organization and management of an emergency room (ER). Nurses will use the application to track and manage patientsâ€™ personal data, vitals, and symptoms. From this data the app will assign patients urgency based on the hospitals policy.

Emergency room:
The emergency room class manages all of the patients. This class handles the creation, storage, and manipulation of all patient personal data. When the app is loaded this class stores all patients as a Map, mapping health card number and birthdate to patient objects. The emergency room can assign an urgency rating to patients based on their vital signs(hospital policy).

Patient:
The patient class manages all the information that revolves around ER patients. Patients themselves cannot change the data, it is assigned to them by nurses. The patient class stores the name, birthdate, health card number, vital signs and symptoms of the patient. 

Vitals:
Vitals class manages all the information that refers vital signs and symptoms. Nurse can add the vital signs and symptoms and also can see the history of the vital signs and symptoms. All vital signs and symptoms that are recorded by nurse, are stored by vitals class within a Map mapping the date and time that the vitals and symptoms were recorded to the actual recordings.

Description of Data persistence:
We decided to use text files to store the data. 

Argument for Design:
Our design balances flexibility and specialization. Initially we planned to have the Patient class automatically calculate urgency. By making the emergency room class assign urgency we make Patient more modular, allowing for patient to be reused if a different emergency room has a different urgency rating system. Overall, this app could have been designed with fewer classes, but only at a significant cost to flexibility.
